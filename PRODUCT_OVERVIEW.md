# Hamilton Incidents

## What This Product Is

Hamilton Incidents is a live map that shows you every emergency call happening across Hamilton, Ontario — right now. Fire, medical, car accidents, gas leaks, alarms — it all shows up on the map within seconds of being dispatched, and updates automatically. No account needed, nothing to install. Just open it and see what's going on in your city.

## Who This Is For

- Hamilton residents who hear sirens and want to know what's happening
- Concerned neighbours checking if a nearby emergency affects them
- Local journalists covering breaking incidents
- Community safety advocates tracking patterns over time
- Anyone curious about how busy Hamilton's emergency services really are

## What Problem It Solves

You hear fire trucks racing down your street. You see smoke in the distance. Your neighbourhood Facebook group is full of speculation. You check the news — nothing yet. You're left guessing.

Hamilton Incidents gives you the answer immediately. No waiting for a news article, no scrolling through social media rumours. Just a map showing exactly what's happening, where, and what kind of emergency it is.

## What You Can Do With It

- **See live incidents on a map** — colour-coded markers show fires, medical calls, accidents, hazmat situations, and more as they're dispatched
- **Filter by type** — only care about fires? Hide everything else with one click
- **Search by address** — type a street name and instantly find incidents near you
- **Look back in time** — slide through up to a week of history to see what happened while you were away
- **Use quick time presets** — jump to the last 2 days, 3 days, or full week with one tap
- **View the full activity log** — see a table of every incident, including calls where the address is withheld for privacy
- **Get details on any incident** — click a marker to see the address, responding units, stations involved, and incident type
- **Share a direct link** — every incident has its own page you can send to someone
- **Use it on your phone** — works on any device, no app download needed

## How It Feels to Use

Fast and calm. The map loads, the markers appear, and you immediately understand what's going on. No clutter, no ads, no login wall. The filters are intuitive — toggle what you want to see, search if you need something specific, slide the time range if you're looking at history. It refreshes quietly in the background so you never have to hit reload. It just works.

## Why It's Different

- **It's real-time** — data comes directly from Hamilton Fire Department's dispatch system, updating every 30 seconds
- **It respects privacy** — medical calls appear in the activity log but addresses are withheld to protect patients
- **It's free and open** — no account, no paywall, no tracking. Just public safety data made accessible
- **It remembers your preferences** — your filters and settings are saved so the map looks the way you left it next time you visit

## A Day in the Life With This Product

It's 10 PM on a Tuesday. You're watching TV when you hear multiple sirens heading east. You pull up Hamilton Incidents on your phone. Three new markers just appeared on the map — a structure fire on Barton Street with four units responding. Not your neighbourhood. You go back to your show.

The next morning over coffee, you slide the time range back to see what happened overnight. A few alarm activations, a couple medical calls, and a car fire on the mountain. You notice there have been three gas leak calls on the same block this week. You mention it at the neighbourhood association meeting that evening.

Your local councillor asks where you got the data. You send them the link.
