- text search filter in event list
    - component state only, no redux

- event filter icons in collapasable menu
    - default to collapsed in mobile

- migrate to koa

- does the api for events need to go to the db? 
    - Server could pull in all events data on load and persist
    - Tradeoff: saves db requests, requires local filtering functions to meet needs of requests
